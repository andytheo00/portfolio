### Welcome to my portfolio 

Here you can find samples of my code in both in R and Python I've in my previous work and free time. 

I'm new to Github so please keep coming back as I keep uploading my work. 

Currently, you will see a Python notebook that predicts conflict in Sub-Saharan. It includes all the code that I used to clean and impute the data, perform some preliminary EDA and finally conduct prediction inference.
